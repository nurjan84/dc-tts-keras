# dc-tts-keras

A Keras implementation of [Efficiently Trainable Text-to-Speech System Based on Deep Convolutional Networks with Guided Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08969)  based on the following projects:

https://github.com/Kyubyong/dc_tts

https://github.com/tugstugi/pytorch-dc-tts

My goals are to learn the deep neural networks and to experiment with training and synthesizing Kazakh language Text-To-Speech. Used 1h:25m single speaker dataset.
